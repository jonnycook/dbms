<?php $subject = 'Caregiver Request Received' ?>
 
Hello <?php echo $name ?>!
 
We have received your request to become a Caregiver for:

Email: <?php echo $recipientInfo['email'] ?>

First Name: <?php echo $recipientInfo['firstName'] ?>

Last Name: <?php echo $recipientInfo['lastName'] ?>


It's very important for you to understand that due to privacy laws we cannot confirm or deny that a person with the entered customer information exists in our system. You will only be notified if the account holder electronically confirms/consents to your caregiver access request. 

Remember, the fastest and most reliable way to become a Caregiver for a Customer is to have the Customer request to add you via their online dashboard or mobile app.

If a person authorizes you to be their Caregiver they may withdraw authorization at anytime without a reason or notice provided to the Caregiver. No notice of refusal of authorization can be provided to anyone. 

We don't mean to be secretive about it; we just take privacy and the law seriously. This message will self-destruct in T-minus-5 seconds. Just kidding.
 
Health & Happiness,
Your divvyTEAM
