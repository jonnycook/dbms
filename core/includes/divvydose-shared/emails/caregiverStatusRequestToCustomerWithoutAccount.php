If you use the link above, your caregiver will have access to your account when it is created. Their email will also be linked so they will receive any updates or changes to your account. 

Your privacy is important to us. You can always revoke this access at anytime by changing your settings on your dashboard or contacting us at help@divvyDOSE.com or 844.693.4889.
